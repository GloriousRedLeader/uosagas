# uosagas assistant scripts

Here you may or may not find useful things:


**Move Items** scripts to put things in various containers. Lots of different flavors and uses. They all present with a target reticle so no need for hard coding anything. Different flavors include:

- [Move all items by type](https://github.com/GloriousRedLeader/uosagas/blob/main/move_items_by_type.lua) from their current container to another container (target item, target destination container)
- [Move all items by type and color](https://github.com/GloriousRedLeader/uosagas/blob/main/move_items_by_type_and_hue.lua) from their current container to another container, you can use this turn in bods (target item, target destination container)
- [Move all items from one container](https://github.com/GloriousRedLeader/uosagas/blob/main/move_all_items_from_container.lua) to another container (target source container, target destination container)

A moderaly decent [Poison / Bandaid / Pop pouch](https://github.com/GloriousRedLeader/uosagas/blob/main/arthurdexbot.lua) script. This will automatically apply poison to blade. It will heal when necessary. It will pop pouches when paralyzed. Don't use pouch popping as a mage because casting spells considers you paralyzed.

Be advised: Run at your own risk. Do not break any rules.
